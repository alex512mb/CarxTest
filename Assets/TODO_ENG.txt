Obligatory:
1) to inspect the project: to redesign, optimize, correct the found defects, or to present them in the text and indicate possible solutions;
2) make a preemptive shooting for CannonTower: add functionality to search for the target and hover over it so that the released projectiles began to fall on the target; shells must fly strictly from the barrel of the gun; the projectile in flight is prohibited to apply any force or adjustments;

Optional:
3) for CannonTower to make the capture and tracking of the target with anticipation; turn the turret gun should be smooth; make it possible to adjust the speed of the gun rotation;
4) for CannonTower to make a preemptive firing mode on a parabolic trajectory (gravity must act on the projectile)
